    "| __Model Type__ | Prophet is a forecasting model. It is designed to handle time series data with __strong seasonal patterns__ and multiple seasonal components. Prophet is based on an additive model that decomposes time series data into trend, seasonal, and holiday components. | LSTM is a type of __recurrent neural network (RNN)__ that is capable of learning __long-term dependencies__ in time series data. It is a deep learning model and is part of the broader field of artificial neural networks. |\n",
    "| __Ease of Use__ | Prophet is known for its __ease of use__ and requires minimal data preprocessing. It can handle missing data and outliers relatively well. Users can easily specify custom seasonal patterns and holidays. | LSTM is __more complex__ to implement and often __requires more data preprocessing__ and feature engineering. It may also require tuning hyperparameters like the number of layers, hidden units, and sequence length. |\n",
    "| __Seasonality Handling__ | Prophet has built-in support for __handling multiple seasonal components__, such as yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality. It can also model holidays and special events. | LSTM can capture seasonality and temporal patterns in data, but it may __require more manual feature engineering__ to handle specific seasonal components. |\n",
    "| __Interpretability__ | Prophet provides __interpretable components for trend, seasonality, and holiday effects__, making it easier to understand the underlying patterns in the data. | LSTM models are typically more complex and __less interpretable__ than Prophet models, making it harder to extract meaningful insights from them. |\n",
    "| __Training Time__ | Training Prophet models is usually __faster__ and requires less computational resources compared to training deep learning models like LSTM. | LSTM models can be __computationally intensive__ to train, especially if you have a large dataset or complex architectures. |\n",
    "| __Performance__ | Prophet is often a good choice for time series with __strong seasonal patterns__. | LSTM may be __more suitable for complex, non-linear__ time series data. |"
